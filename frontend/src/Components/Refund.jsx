                At Hiddenvalley Stays, we understand that travel plans may
                change due to unforeseen circumstances. Our refund and
                cancellation policy is designed to be fair and transparent while
                considering seasonal demand, operational costs, and reservation
                commitments. Please review our policy carefully before making a
                booking.
              </p>
              <p>
                This policy applies to direct bookings made through our website,
                official contact numbers, or email. If you have booked through
                third-party platforms (e.g., Airbnb, Booking.com, TripAdvisor,
                or travel agencies), please refer to their respective refund and
                cancellation policies, as they may differ from ours.

              <h2>A) Standard Cancellation Terms</h2>

                <li>
                  Cancellations made 30 days or more before check-in: Guests are
                  eligible for a full refund, minus a 5% processing fee to cover
                  administrative and transaction costs.

                <li>
                  Guests must provide accurate personal information during the
                  booking process.

              <h2>B) Special Cancellation Terms for Peak Seasons & Holidays</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  During peak seasons, festive holidays, and long weekends,
                  refund policies may be stricter due to high demand.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cancellation terms for such periods will be communicated at
                  the time of booking and will supersede the standard refund
                  policy.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In most cases, cancellations during peak periods may not be
                  eligible for any refunds due to operational commitments.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you wish to modify your booking dates instead of canceling,
                  we offer date change options under the following conditions:
                </li>
                <li>
                  Rescheduling requests must be made at least 7 days before the
                  check-in date.
                </li>
                <li>
                  All date changes are subject to availability and may not be
                  guaranteed, especially during peak periods.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the new travel dates fall under a higher seasonal tariff,
                  guests must pay the difference in rates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If rescheduling is not possible, the cancellation policy will
                  apply.
                </li>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  If a guest fails to check in on the scheduled date without
                  prior notice (No-Show), the entire booking amount will be
                  forfeited, and no refund will be issued.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a guest checks out earlier than the reserved duration, no
                  refund will be provided for the unused nights.
                </li>

                Hiddenvalley Stays is not liable for cancellations caused by
                circumstances beyond our control. In such cases, we may offer
                rescheduling options instead of refunds, subject to
                availability. These circumstances include but are not limited to
                the following:
              </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                  If an event falls under force majeure, we will work with
                  guests to reschedule their stay rather than process a refund.
